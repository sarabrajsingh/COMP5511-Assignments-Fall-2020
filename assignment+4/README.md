# COMP5511-Assignments-Fall-2020

This program provides a variety of search functionalities for geographic locations obtained from datasets published on the Canada Geographic Names Information System. The program creates in-memory data structures in order to provide users the ability to query a given file, using a geographic location's id, latitude, longitude, name, generic term and location. Users can input any number of queries for any number of features. The matching results are presented in an output file. 

# Quick Start

1. Run `bash compile.sh` in order to compile all the classes within the package.
2. Run `java Main.java <path to data file> <path to query file> <path to output file>`. If you want to use the files already contained in this repository, you would run `data/cgn_on_csv_eng.csv log_files/queries.txt log_files/output.txt`. The query file needs to follow the structure outlined in the Queries section.
